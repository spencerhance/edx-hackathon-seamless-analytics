# Setup
In order to access the HipChat API, you need to setup an access token https://edx.hipchat.com/account/api.
Alternatively, you can use their OATH flow, but that's a but unecessary for this hackathon.

On the api site, create a new "View Messages" token and input into the AUTH_TOKEN field
Add the room ID into the room URL field
